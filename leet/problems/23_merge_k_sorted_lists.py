    In the simple case where there are 2 sorted lists to be merged,
    it is trivial to merge them in O(n), where n is the total number of
    elements in the 2 lists. We denote this operation as `merge2(l1, l2)`.

    Consider there are more than 2 sorted lists. One plausible solution is to
    reduce the lists with `merge2`, like `reduce(merge2, lists)`, or more
    specifically:

        merged = []
        for list in lists:
            merged = merge2(merged, list)

    The time complexity is O(n * k), where k is the number of lists. Note
    that in each iteration, `list` is processed with all elements merged so
    far, which is a waste. Observe that merging k lists can be broken into
    k/2 `merge2` subproblems. By applying this recursively, we come to a
    divide and conquer solution:

        while len(lists) > 1:
            lists = [merge2(*every_2_lists) for every_2_lists in lists]
        return lists[0]

    In each iteration of the while loop, it takes O(n) for all the `merge2`
    operations. Each loop reduce the number of lists roughly by 1/2. Summing
    this up, the time complexity of the solution is O(n * log(k, 2)).
